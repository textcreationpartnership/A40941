            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And concerning the Paſſover, there was and is a Spirituall Feaſt to be kept amongſt the Saints and true Chriſtians, for Chriſt is their Paſſover, who is ſacrifized for them:
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7.8.</note>

So that as Chriſt is the Saints Paſſeover, and is Sacrificed for them, they are to keep a ſpiritual feaſt, that is to ſay the Feaſt of Un-leaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bread, &amp; the bread they are to keep this feaſt with is the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened bread of ſincerity and truth, and Chriſt who is the Saints Paſſeover, is the Unleavened bread of ſincerity and truth, or the bread of life come down from Heaven for them to keep the Feaſt with, and as he is the bread which the Saints are to break, or adminiſter and feed ſpiritually upon, ſo he is the wine or water of life to refreſh ſouls ſpiritually withall, for he is the ſpirituall Vine, and as wine is the vertue of the Vine, ſo the vertue of Chriſt who is the true ſpiritual Vine is as ſpiritual wine to the ſouls of the Saints, for their refreſhment and great conſolation; and if to receive

            <p>And concerning the Church, it conſiſts of Regenerate ones, who live up to a righteouſneſſe of Faith towards God, and a righteouſneſſe of life both towards God and man. Firſt, In forſaking the Divel and all his works, and, Secondly, In keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods holy will and conmandements, and walking in the ſame all the daies of their lives, being ſuch as are governed and are ſanctified by the ſpirit of God, and are of the houſhold and family of God, and this is according to the conſtitutions and Cannons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> then to meet together in point of Religion and worſhip of God with them, that live up to a righteouſneſſe of Faith towards God, and a righteouſneſſe of life both towards God and man, who are regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or born again, and are of the houshold and family of God, who are alſo ſanctified arid governed by the ſpirit of God, is to come to the Church, though they cannot meet in point of Religion and worſhip with them that are not ſuch as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and with ſuch as aboveſaid we meet with all in point of Religion and Worſhip of God, therefore we come to the Church and worſhip of God as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>And acording to the Scriptures, the Church is in God the Father of out Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> but Steeple-houſes, or Pariſh-meeting places are not in God, how then are they Churches, and why are people presented and puniſhed, for not coming to Steeple-houſes or Pariſh-meeting-places, ſeeing they are not Churches according to the Scriptures, for
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silvanius</hi> and <hi>Timothyus,</hi> write to the Church of the Theſſalonians, <hi>which is in God the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> but in writing to the Church in God, they did not write to Steeple-houſes or Pariſh-meeting-places, therefore people may be in the Church, and come to the Church according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, though they come not to the Pariſh-meeting-places, 1 <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians,</hi> 1. and 2. <hi>Theſſa.</hi>

Seeing that God is a ſpirit, and requireth his people to worſhip him in ſpirit: why ſhould they be compelled from the worſhip of God in ſpirit, or puniſhed, and perſecuted, if they do not forſake the way and worſhip of God, to follow the Ceremonies and Inventions of Men? what cauſe is there for it? but that the Scriptures may be fulfilled, is this come to paſſe. For Chriſt Jeſus hath ſaid to the Diſciples, and true Believers in him, they ſhall put you out of the Synagogues, yea the time cometh, that whoſoever killeth you will think that he doth God good ſervice. And theſe things will they do unto you, becauſe they have not known the Father, nor me, <hi>John</hi> 16.2, 3.</p>
            <p>It is evident, &amp; that by the Scriptures, or prophecy of Chriſt. Firſt that the Diſciples of Chriſt, and true believers in him, ſhall be excommunicated, or put out of the ſynagogues. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the believers in Chriſt, and worſhippers of God the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103515:5"/>Father in ſpirit and truth, ſhall be in great danger of their lives, for ſaith Chriſt in his prophecie, <hi>John</hi> 16.2. They ſhall excommunicate you, or put you out of the ſynagogues, and that part of the prophecie of Chriſt is fulfilled, and now in fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: Yea the time cometh that whoſoever killeth you, will think he doth God ſervice, and is not that part of Chriſts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie alſo near at hand to be fulfilled. Two things are very obſervable from hence. Firſt, That the Saints and Believers in Chriſt ſhall be excommunicated, or put out of the ſinagogues by Enemies or Strangers to Chriſt. Secondly, That after excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, or being put out of the ſinagogues by ſuch, they ſhall be in great danger of their Lives.</p>
            <p>If it be asked, who they are that ſhall deal thus hardly and cruelly with the Saints and Believers in Chriſt: as Firſt, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate them, or caſt them out of the ſynagogues, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter endanger their lives? It is anſwered in the 16 Chapter of <hi>John</hi> 2 and 3
<hi>verſeſ,</hi> by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath ſaid, theſe things will they do unto you; and why? The reaſon given by the Lord Jeſus is this, becauſe (ſaith he) they have not known the Father nor me.</p>
            <p>It is evident therefore, and that by the Scriptures, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie of Chriſt, that ignorant men, who know neither God, nor Chriſt, but are ſtrangers unto them, will deal ſo hardly, and cruelly with the Saints, and true believers in Chriſt, as to Excommunicate them, or put them out of the ſynagogues, and after endanger their lives, by poſſeſſing the ignorant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly with a falſe confidence: that to kill the Saints under the notion of Hereticks, is good ſervice and done for the glory of God. But theſe things the Saints have been in expectation of, and they come, not untold of by Chriſt, nor unlooked for by them, for theſe things have I told you (ſaid Chriſt) that when the time ſhall come, yee may remember that I told you of them,
<hi>John</hi> 16.4.</p>
            <p>And in the dayes of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> the Lord had a broken hearted People, who trembled at the word of the Lord: for which cauſe they were hated, and excommunicated, or caſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103515:6"/>out of Church fellowſhip: and they that hated them, and caſt them out, pretended the glory of God in that act of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, or caſting them out as aforeſaid; but the Lord ſent his Prophet with a Meſſage that included two things. Firſt, Gods owning of that broken hearted people, who trembled at his word, when they were excommunicated, or caſt out by their pretended Brethren, who covered their act of excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or caſting them out with the pretence of bringing glory to God. And ſecondly Gods diſlike unto, and diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them: that ſo excommunicated or caſt them out from amongſt them ſaying, hear the word of the Lord, all ye that tremble at his word, your Brethren that hated you, and caſt you out for my names ſake: ſaid, <hi>Let the Lord be glorified, but he ſhall appear to your joy, and they ſall be aſhamed, Iſa.</hi> 66.5.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is to be obſerved, that God promiſed to appear to them that were Excommunicated, or caſt out, and not only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, but he alſo promiſed to appear to their joy. And if to their joy, that were ſo Excommunicated, or caſt out, then for their encouragement, and for the owning of them. And Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, It is to be obſerved that God promiſed to appear to them that did Excommunicate, or caſt them out, but it ſhould be to their ſhame; and if to their ſhame, then not to the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them in their Act of Excommunication, or as aforeſaid. They that are Excommunicated, or caſt out becauſe of their love, and faithfulneſſe to the Lord, need not to be aſhamed, though they that hate them, and caſt them our, account them hereticks, and pretend they do it for the Glory of God. Their Excommunicating, or caſting of them out cannot hinder God for owning of them, nor for appearing to them for their joy. For he hath promiſed to appear to them for their joy, that are ſo hated and caſt out, and to the ſhame of them that ſo hates them, and caſts them out as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Who are they that Chriſt ſaid, the Ignorant, who know not God, ſhould Excommunicate, or put out of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues and after endanger their live? <hi>John</hi> 16.2.3. I anſwer, Firſt, They are ſuch as are beloved of Chriſt, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103515:6"/>commanded to continue in his love. <hi>John</hi> 15.9. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they are ſuch as are in Chriſt Jeſus, as branches in a Vine, who are purged that they may bring forth fruit unto God. <hi>John</hi> 15.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Thirdly, they are ſuch as are the friends of Chriſt, who manifeſt their love to him, by abiding in him, and keeping his Commandements,
<hi>John</hi> 15.4, 14.</p>
            <p>For what cauſe do they Hate, Perſecute, Excommunicate and endanger the lives of the Friends of Chriſt, who abide in him, and keep his Commandements. I anſwer, Firſt, becauſe they are choſen of Chriſt. Secondly, Becauſe they are ordained, that they ſhould goe and bring forth fruit unto God. John 15.16. Thirdly, Becauſe they abide in the Doctrine of Chriſt, and love one another, as he hath commanded, <hi>John</hi> 15.17. Fourthly, Becauſe they are not of the World, but are choſen out of the World, as Chriſt hath declared and ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 15.19.</p>
            <p>Are theſe the cauſes, why the people of God reproachfully called <hi>Quakers,</hi> together with the Saints and Believers in Chriſt, are hated, perſecuted, and Excommunicated? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Yea, theſe are the very cauſes, becauſe they abide in Chriſt and keep his commands.</p>
            <p>For if they ſhould depart from Chriſt, and go into the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the World, and ceaſe being Godly and Righteous, and learn to be deboyſt and wicked, and comply with the ſpirit of the World in its wayes and Worſhips, then perſection againſt them would be at an end, and ceaſe.</p>
            <p>And if they ſhould daily erre, and go aſtray from the waies of God, and follow the devices and deſires of their own hearts, and ceaſe bringing forth fruit unto God, diſobey the Commands of Chriſt, and daily offend againſt Gods Holy Laws, and be miſerable ſinners, then perſecution would ceaſe.</p>
            <p>Who are they that are the haters and perſecutors of the Friends of Chriſts Saints and Believers in him? I anſwer,</p>
            <p>Firſt, They are the World.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:103515:7"/>
            <p>Secondly, They are ſuch as are haters of Chriſt, for ſaith he, <hi>If the World hate you ye know that it hated me before it hated you, John</hi> 15.18.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They are ſuch as are of the ſame nature and ſpirit which they were of, that perſecuted Chriſt, who hath ſaid by way of remembrance, <hi>That the Servant is not greater then the Lord, if they have perſecuted me they will alſo perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute you,</hi> John 15.20.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, They are ſuch as know not God, as Chriſt hath ſaid, all theſe things will they do for my names ſake, <hi>becauſe they know not him that ſent me,</hi> John 15.21.</p>
            <p>And they hated <hi>Chriſt</hi> without a cauſe, <hi>John</hi> 15.25. So do they hate his friends without a cauſe, for if they could depart from him, and diſobey his commands, and enter into the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the World again, and be one with the world in profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and will-worſhip, then perſecution would ceaſe, as Chriſt hath ſaid; <hi>If ye were of the World, the World would love his own, but becauſe I have choſen you out of</hi> (the profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, will-worſhip and ſpirit of) <hi>the World, therefore the World hateth you,</hi> John 15.19.</p>
            <p>And inaſmuch as the friends of Chriſt are hated without a cauſe, there is no juſt cauſe, why the Saints and Believers in Chriſt ſhould be hated and perſecuted: But as then he that was born after the fleſh, perſecuted him that was born after the ſpirit, even ſo it is now, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.29.</p>
            <p>But as then he that is born after the fleſh, had no right nor authority from God given to perſecute him that was born af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſpirit, no more hath he now. For they that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.8. But perſecutors are in the fleſh, therefore perſecutors cannot pelaſe God, neither have they that are in the fleſh any right given from God to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them that are in the ſpirit, in whom the righteouſneſſe of the Law is fulfilled, even in them who walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit, as it is written,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The true ſpiritual Chriſtians, who are regenerate, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103515:7"/>born after the ſpirit: they are the true believers in Chriſt; and worſhippers of God the Father, in ſpirit, who are ſought and taught of the Lord according to his word.</p>
            <p>Therefore, there is no reaſon why they ſhould be hated, and perſecuted: neither hath the ſpirit of the world any right or authority given unto it from God, to hate and perſecute them, that are regenerate and born of God. For they that are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and born of God, are the houſhold and family of God, and have acceſs unto him, by the ſpirit through his ſon, as it is written, <hi>Epheſ,</hi> 2.18.19.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, becauſe they have crucified the fleſh, with the affections and luſts, and do live in the ſpirit, and walk in the ſpirit, and bring forth the fruits of the ſpirit, againſt which there is no law,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22, 23, 24, 25.</p>
            <p>For the law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus hath made them free from the Law of Sin and Death: and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of the law is fulfilled in them, <hi>Rom,</hi> 8.1, 2.
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if there be no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who have forſaken the fleſh, and are entred into the Spirit and life of truth to walk after the ſpirit, and worſhip the Father therein, being dead unto ſin, and alive unto God, through Chriſt Jeſus our Lord,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6.7, 8, 9, 10, 11. What right reaſon can any one give for the haring, reviling, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting or baniſhing of them: <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the change of Gods Elect,</hi> ſeeing, <hi>it is God that juſtifieth</hi> them, <hi>Who is he that condemneth?</hi> ſeeing, <hi>it is Chriſt that dyed, who is riſen again, who is even at the right hand of God,</hi> an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour, <hi>who alſo maketh interceſſion for us,</hi> Rom. 8.32, 33.34.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They are the true ſpiritual Chriſtians, and Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of God the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who being born again of water and the ſpirit are ingrafted, or begotten into Chriſt, the ſeed and power of God, and are therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clated new Creatures and Children of God.</p>
            <p>Why then ſhould ſuch be hated, perſecuted, excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or baniſhed? What right reaſon can be ſhewed for the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103515:8"/>fame? for we know that whoſoever is born of God ſinneth not, but he that is begotten of God keepeth himſelf, and that wicked one toucheth him not: and we know that we are of God, and the whole world lyeth in wickedneſs: and we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true: even in his Son Jeſus Chriſt, this is the true God, and life eternal, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.18, 19,
20.</p>
            <p>Lye not one to another, ſeeing you have put of the old man with his deeds: and have put on the new man, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in knowledge after the Image of him that created him; where there is neither <hi>Greek,</hi> nor <hi>Jew, Barbarian, Scythian,</hi> bond or free, but Chriſt is All, and in All, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.9, 10, 11. As ye therefore have received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, ſo walk yee in him, rooted and built up in him, and eſtabliſhed in the Faith:as yee have been taught, abounding therein with thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.6, 7. Therefore if any man be in Chriſt Jeſus, he is a new creature 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17, 18. <hi>Behold, what manner of love is this, that the Father hath beſtowed on us, that we ſhould be called the Sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, becauſe it knew him not,</hi> 1 John 3.1. Be yee therefore followers of God, as dear children, and walk in love, as Chriſt alſo hath loved us, and hath given himſelf for us, an offering and ſacrifice to God; for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour, <hi>Epheſ.</hi>
5.1, 2. And becauſe yee are ſons, God hath ſent forth the ſpirit of his Son into your hearts crying, <hi>Abba</hi> Father, wherfore thou art no more a ſervant, but a ſon, and if a ſon, then an heire of God through Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6, 7,</p>
            <p n="4">4. They are the true ſpiritual Chriſtians, believers in Chriſt, and the true worſhippers of God the Father in ſpirit, and in truth, who being regenerate, are ſanctified through the word and are in Chriſt Jeſus as branches in the Vine. And ſuch ought not to be hated and perſecuted by them that profeſs themſelves Chriſtians: for the kindneſs and love of God our Saviour towards man, appeared not by works of righteouſneſs which we have done; but according to his mercy he ſaved us,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103515:8"/>by the waſhing of regeneration, and renewing of the holy Ghoſt, which he ſhed on us abundantly through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour: that being juſtified by his grace, we ſhould be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4, 5, 6.
<hi>John</hi> 15.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They that are in Chriſt Jeſus, as branches in the Vine, bearing fruit, they are purged that they may bring forth more fruit, <hi>John</hi> 15.1, 2.</p>
            <p>And they that are ſo in Union with Chriſt, as branches in him, and purged, or made clean through the word, that they may abide in him, and he in them, they bring forth much fruit unto God by vertue of that union, for as the branch cannot bear fruit of it ſelf, except it abide in the vine, no more can true Chriſtians and worſhippers of God the Father in ſpirit, except they abide in Chriſt Jeſus, and grow up in him, <hi>John</hi> 15.3, 4, 5. And they that are ſuch, and do ſo, ought not to be perſecuted, or baniſhed by them that profeſs love to the Lord Jeſus: no juſt cauſe by them can be ſhewed for it: and the Heathen, who know not God, they have no right to do it.</p>

            <p>Dear Frinds, know that it is given unto you to know the things conſerning the miſtery and Kingdome of God, but to others in Parables.</p>
            <p>And ſo it is given to you, and all true ſpiritual believers on Chriſt, in the ſpirit, not onely to believe, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake.</p>
            <p>And as believing is a gift given from God in the Spirit, ſoalſo is ſuffering for his name ſake a gift, its given unto you to ſuffer.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103515:10"/>Therefore mind the end and intent of God in the gift, ſo will you not be weary of ſufferings, neither will any forſake the truth of God that are truly begotten into it who are born of it, and do contiune and abide therein with God in the ſpirit.</p>
            <p>If any depart from God for fear of ſufferings, and fall into love with the ſpirit &amp; way of the world, to obtain the favour of the world, and to avoid perſecution; it is either ſuch as have not received the gift from God, to fit and furniſh them for a ſuffering condition for Chriſt and the Goſpel, or elſe it is ſuch as denies both the gift and the giver.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding truth is truth ſtill, and will ſtand in the midſt of all ſtorms, do you therefore continue and abide in the truth, in the Life, Love, and Power thereof; So will you continue and abide with the Lord, and be ſitted and furniſhed with gifts and graces, and Goſpel abillitics, that you may ſtand and not ſtart aſide when you are tryed.</p>
            <p>Oh feel the power and vertue of the Lord enter into and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main with your ſpirits, to work down, burn up, and purge out the ſelf-will, and the old reaſoning fleſhly part, that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of your ſouls may be withſtood and kept back, or cruſht down in all his inſinuations, twiſtings, twineings, and ſubtle devices, or cunning miſterious appearances and riſings, that your ſouls may be kept in the life and power of the ſpirit of God, which treads down Satans devices, and knows how to withſtand him in all his out-goings.</p>
            <p>And as the riſings of divine life, and ſpringings up of the heavenly power, is felt working in you to put down Satans ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and to croſs the out-goings of the enemy within you, and cauſe him to diſappear there.</p>
            <p>Then Angels will miniſter unto you, or the Holy Ghoſt ſent down from heaven as a miniſtering ſpirit ſent from God into your harts, will open, refreſh, and fill you with the joy and peace of the Kingdome of heaven.</p>
            <p>Therefore mind the unwearied life of the ſpirit of Chriſt in you, which is not wearied out with temptations and tryals, but knows how to ſuccour your ſouls in the hour of temptation, and

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103515:10"/>to bring forth an inward deliverance for you, that you may be freed from the power of the enemie, and be at liberty and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in ſpirit, to ſerve and worſhip the Lord according to his own mind in the way of our God.</p>
            <p>So will you not be weary of ſufferings, but overcome that which would be weary of a ſuffering condition, and know the Lord to fill you with joy and gladneſſe of heart in a priſon, and to be with you in a ſuffering condition, whoſe life is known to be an unwearied life, and to ſtand in the end of all ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and fill with divine joy and gladneſſe of heart: all dear friends live in Love with God and one with another, and keep your meetings in the name and power of God in which you are gathered, that in your meetings you may meet with God in ſpirit for your refreſhment.</p>
            <p>And take heed of giving way to the ſeducing ſpirit, that would either be perſwading to go back again into that way of Worſhip which God hath called you from, or to be out of love and in diſlike to that way and Worſhip which God hath made known himſelf unto you in, for neither of theſe perſwaſions cometh of him that hath called you out of the way and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the ſpirit of the world, and into the way and Worſhip of the ſpirit of God.</p>
            <p>Therefore as you have begun in the Spirit of God, go not from it to enter again into the Spirit of the world for any by end: If you love God above all, you will love to walk with him, and to worſhip him as God, according to his own mind, in ſpirit and in truth, which is the publick worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>And therefore hold faſt the profeſſion of your faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wavering; waver not in your minds, leaſt you wander from God in your hearts, and be terrified or afrighted at ſufferings,
<hi>For many are the troubles of the righteous, but the Lord deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers out of them all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Have you had more troubles then deliverances, or have you not had as many deliverances as you have had troubles: why then ſhould any be diſmayed, who have been and ſtill are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103515:11"/>with the way and means both of the coming and working of the Spirit, and power of our God.</p>
            <p>For bleſſed and happie, arc they that have the Lord for their God: and you have the Lord in communion of ſpirit, and in covenant with you, who are called and choſen of God.</p>
            <p>Therefore you are bleſſed of God, be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might: Let the Lord be your ſtrength, that you may be kept by his power to his praiſe, and that you may alwayes be found in that of himſelf wherein you and your ſervices have been and ſtill are accepted of him, is the deſire of him who deſires your ſpiritual welfare, and everlaſting hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, whoſe love is reached forth unto you in a pure remem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>brance, in that ſpirit wherein we have had many refreſhings from God, and ſignal teſtimonics of his love, and Antient ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with God, and one with another in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of light, and life, and peace, <hi>Farewell.</hi>
